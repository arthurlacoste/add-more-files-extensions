## Description

Add more files extensions with a new field in your Medias Settings. 

**[You can check the dev page](http://irz.fr/add-more-files-extensions/)**

You just need to insert your extensions in `Settings > Medias > Uploading Files` separate by a space (ex : 'exe pdf rar'), and the plugin does the rest.

This plugin is in french but the translation in english is in progress.
